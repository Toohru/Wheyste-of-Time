## 🚀 DEPLOYMENT INSTRUCTIONS

### Option 1: Deploy to Vercel (Easiest - Recommended)

#### Step 1: Get Your Icons
1. Go to https://favicon.io/emoji-favicons/fork-and-knife/
2. Download the package
3. Rename `android-chrome-192x192.png` → `icon-192.png`
4. Rename `android-chrome-512x512.png` → `icon-512.png`
5. Put both files in the `public` folder (create it if needed)

#### Step 2: Create GitHub Repo
1. Go to https://github.com/new
2. Create a new repository (name it whatever you want)
3. Don't initialize with anything
4. Upload ALL your project files to the repo

#### Step 3: Deploy on Vercel
1. Go to https://vercel.com
2. Sign up with GitHub (free)
3. Click "New Project"
4. Import your GitHub repository
5. Vercel auto-detects Vite - just click "Deploy"
6. Wait 1-2 minutes... DONE! 🎉

**Your app will be live at:** `https://your-project-name.vercel.app`

### Option 2: Deploy to Netlify (Also Free)

#### Step 1: Get Icons (same as above)

#### Step 2: Install Dependencies & Build Locally
```bash
# In your project folder
npm install
npm run build
```

This creates a `dist` folder with your built app.

#### Step 3: Deploy to Netlify
1. Go to https://app.netlify.com
2. Sign up (free)
3. Drag & drop the entire `dist` folder
4. Done! 🎉

**Icons don't show:**
- Icons must be in `public/` folder
- Named exactly `icon-192.png` and `icon-512.png`

**App doesn't install on phone:**
- Make sure you deployed (not just viewing local files)
- Use Safari on iOS, Chrome on Android
- May need to visit site 2-3 times first
